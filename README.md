### Server for build sharing

The server for build sharing is located in the `server` directory. For deployment, the content of the `dist` folder generated by building the front app must be located into a `front` directory in the server's working directory.

Builds are stored using sqlite, in a file named "build-db.sqlite" located in the server's working directory, and expire after 6 months. It is recommended to clear this file with each new deployment to avoid old builds causing errors in case something has changed in the game files.

The server should be running behind an apache or nginx proxy configured with gzip and caching.

**Caching exceptions:**
- `front/service-worker.js` and `front/sitemap.xml` should NOT be cached
